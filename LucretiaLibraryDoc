Main idea: 

Problem:
I have problems deciding what is the next book to read/listen to in my vast library

What I have:
I have a spreadsheet (in google docs) that lists a few items in my library by Title & Author.

Solution:
I want to pull in data into my google docs from external sources to help me decide what to read. 
Items to pull in:
* goodreads rating of book
* goodreads # of ratings (1 5-star rating <<<< 2000 4-star ratings)
* number of pages 
* length of audiobook
* book summary
* word cloud if possible? Not sure if can do this
